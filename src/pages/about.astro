    <h1 class="title">About Me</h1>
    <p class="about-para">
        I'm a software engineer with over five years of programming experience
        and more than a decade working in design. I taught myself tools like
        Photoshop and Illustrator at a young age and still consider graphic
        design one of my strongest skills. My work sits at the intersection of
        software engineering and design, and I care deeply about how things feel
        to use, not just whether they work.
    </p>
    <p class="about-para">
        I'm currently a student at Villanova University in the B.S./M.S. program
        for Computer Science and Software Engineering. My work spans full-stack
        web development, general software development, and the translation of
        design ideas into production-ready code.

    <h2 class="about-head">How I Work</h2>
    <ul class="about-list">
        <li>I prioritize clarity over cleverness in both code and UI</li>
        <li>I think about systems, not just individual features</li>
        <li>I value simple, maintainable solutions</li>
        <li>I iterate quickly and refine details deliberately</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="about-head">Background</h2>
    <p class="about-para">
        From a young age, I was drawn to creating experiences. I made board
        games for my family, experimented with Scratch, and later taught myself
        Adobe design tools while creating YouTube thumbnails. I also explored
        music creation and physical art, which shaped how I think about
        creativity and structure.
    </p>
    <p class="about-para">
        In high school, I began to seriously consider technology as a creative
        medium. Choosing to major in Computer Science was challenging, but
        ultimately a natural fit. I'm now pursuing my master's degree and plan
        to continue building thoughtful, well-crafted software throughout my
        career.
